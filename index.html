      <h3>One thing I am thankful for is:</h3>
      <h1>The Internet</h1>

        <p>The internet has changed everyone's lives. For me, it has made my life so much better. All of my main interests and hobbies involve the internet, so I don't know what I would do in my free time without it.
        The internet also allows me to talk to people anytime anywhere. This means I am able to still talk to my sister who is in college, or my grandparents who live several miles away while I'm in my own house. Most importantly though,
        I have made several lifelong friends through the internet, who I likely would have never met or become friends with otherwise.</p>
